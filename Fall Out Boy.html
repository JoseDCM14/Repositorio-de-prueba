<p>After several years of experience, Joe Trohman and Pete Wentz got together to form a great idea: the creation of a rock band that would not look like the ones that were playing at that time. This happened in 2001 in Chicago, Illinois. When evaluating their qualities, the guitarist and bassist realized that a singer and a drummer would be missing to complete the group.</p>

<p>That's how, one day, Joe Trohman found his lead singer. It was Patrick Stump, who was in a bookstore talking aloud about Neurosis, an American metal band. Joe, who felt sympathy for that group, joined the conversation, and without wasting time he presented the idea of his nascent idea, still without a name, to Stump.</p>

<p>After making a small audition, Joe and Pete noticed the great vocal potential that Stump possessed, reason why they immediately granted him the function of main singer. For the guitar they hired T.J. Racine, also a native of Chicago, and Mike Pareskuwicz to be the drummer. They were joined by Pete Wentz on the bass, these members took a year to define their musical style, because the proposal they would present to the public had to be the best.

<p>Uprising Records was the record company chosen by the group to distribute their work. Thus, in 2002, presented to the public their first demo, the first step before Fall Out Boy dared to produce an EP, ie an extended production. This was released on May 28, 2002, and its reception was very positive for both critics and rock fans. </p>

<p>However, it was in 2003 that the group decided to release their first studio album, which was entitled Fall Out Boy's Evening Out With Your Girlfriend. Although the band got a large number of followers in a short time, it was not until 2005 with his second album that managed to permeate the most recognized playlists in the world.</p>

<p>This album was named From Under the Cork Tree, and received the certification of Double Platinum for their copies sold, which exceeded 2.5 million only in the U.S. territory. By that time, Andrew Hurley was the new member of the band, while T.J. Racine and Mike Pareskuwicz left it.
</p>

<p>For its part, February 6, 2007 was the date chosen for the release of Infinity on High, the third album of Fall Out Boy. Unlike the marked features of pop punk that had the first two productions, the latter was more focused on including choral and even orchestral arrangements, in addition to the incursion of R & B, an African American music genre. </p>

<p>After a series of changes in the release dates and also in the singles that would be included in the band's fourth album, it was on December 16, 2008 that it was presented to the public. This production was called Folie à Deux, and with its release the members of Fall Out Boy also announced a short break, where everyone would try their luck as a soloist.</p>

<p>The Fall Out Boy members' solo careers were not what they had hoped for, so they reconvened in early 2012. After experiencing some strong emotions, the musicians decided to reinvent themselves to find a creative outlet for their situations. On April 16, 2016, they released Save Rock and Roll, their fifth studio album and their reunion, which had happened in secret from critics and even the public.

<p>The success of this production was such, that it occupied the first place in the Billboard 100 list, besides being recognized with the Golden Record. On the other hand, Fall Out Boy didn't take long to create a new record production, so on January 16, 2015 they were presenting their sixth studio album entitled American Beauty/American Psycho. Patrick Stump commented at that time that it was an album full of pop rock and pop punk, as in its beginnings.

<p>Three years later, Fall Out Boy worked on the production of their seventh studio album titled MANIA, which was released on January 19, 2018. As expected, fans of the band were delighted with the singles that are within this production.</p>
